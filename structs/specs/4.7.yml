  Description: >-
      The Trading Status message is used to indicate the current trading status
      of a security. A Trading Status message will be sent whenever a security’s
      trading status changes. In addition, Cboe will send a Trading Status
      message for all securities that are “Halted” or have a price test in
      effect before the start of trading hours.

      Trading Status of `S` will be implied at system startup. `T` will be sent
      as securities are available for trading. `A` will be distributed when
      orders can be accepted for queuing in preparation for the market open.
