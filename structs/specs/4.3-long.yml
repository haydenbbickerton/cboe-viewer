- Name: Add Order (long)
  Section: "4.3"
  Description: >-
      An Add Order message represents a newly accepted visible order on the Cboe
      book. It includes a day-specific Order ID assigned by Cboe to the order.
      The Display field is used to reflect whether or not the order can be
      considered a protected quote and thus reportable to the SIP.

      The long version of the Add Order message has been made available to
      accommodate larger symbol sizes possible through the ISRA plan.

      NOTE: If an order’s Price or Display values change within the Cboe
      matching engine, a Cancel Order Message will be immediately followed by a
      new Add Order message with the same Order ID as the original order. An
      order that changes its Display value from “N” to “Y” will not lose its
      priority.
