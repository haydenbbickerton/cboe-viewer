- Name: Order Cancel
  Section: "4.4.2"
  Description: >-
      Order Cancel messages are sent when a visible order on the Cboe book is
      canceled in whole or in part.

      NOTE:  Order Modification messages (4.4.x) refer to an Order ID previously
      sent with an Add Order message. Multiple Order Modification messages may
      modify a single order and the effects are cumulative. Order Modification
      messages always reduce the remaining shares in the referenced open order
      by the number of shares indicated. When the remaining shares for an order
      reach zero, the order is dead and should be removed from the book.
