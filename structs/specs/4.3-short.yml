- Name: Add Order (short)
  Section: "4.3"
  Description: >-
      An Add Order message represents a newly accepted visible order on the Cboe
      book. It includes a day-specific Order ID assigned by Cboe to the order.
      The Display field is used to reflect whether or not the order can be
      considered a protected quote and thus reportable to the SIP.

      NOTE: If an order’s Price or Display values change within the Cboe
      matching engine, a Cancel Order Message will be immediately followed by a
      new Add Order message with the same Order ID as the original order. An
      order that changes its Display value from “N” to “Y” will not lose its
      priority.
