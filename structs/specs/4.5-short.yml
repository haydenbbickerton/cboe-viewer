- Name: Trade (short)
  Section: "4.5"
  Description: >-
      The Trade message provides information about executions of non-displayed
      orders or shares on the Cboe book and routed orders. Trade messages are
      necessary to calculate Cboe execution based data. Trade messages do not
      alter the book and can be ignored if you are just building a book.

      No Add Order message is sent for non-displayed and routed orders, and
      thus, no modify order messages may be sent when non-displayed orders are
      executed. Instead, a Trade message is sent whenever a hidden or routed
      order is executed in whole or in part. A Trade message is also sent when
      there is an execution against any non-displayed portion of a reserve
      order. As with visible orders, hidden orders may be executed in parts. A
      complete view of all Cboe executions can be built by combining all Order
      Executed messages and Trade messages.

      The OrderID of a non-displayed order is obfuscated by default in the Trade
      message, but may be optionally disseminated for a memberâ€™s own orders upon
      request. As such, partial executions against the same hidden order will by
      default have different OrderIDs.
